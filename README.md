# Welcome to my Algorithmic Trading Project!


# Inspiration:
I have always had a love for both stock trading and software engineering. Throughout the course of my time as a student, I've learned quite a lot of machine learning and deep learning concepts. In particular, Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) stood out to be as being very useful in stock market predictions.


# Tech Stack:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Alpaca
- SkLearn


# Research:
While researching how I'd like to carry out my project, Alpaca's API stood out as an easy way to acquire data on a multitude of tickers and easily paper trade them. To test out the efficiency of the model, I selected the top 10 best and worst performing stocks of the discal year.


# Model Training & Predictions:
I decided to use stock market data from the 2022 fiscal quarter as training dataset and the 2023 fiscal quarter as the validation dataset. I finally set on comparing the current 10-day moving average for each ticker to the model's forecast for the next 10-day moving average


# Investing:
I created my account to start with a principal of $1,000,000. I decided on this as it provided enough capital to invest in a variety of stocks and allow for a better gauge on the model's performance.
